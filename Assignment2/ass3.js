// You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.

//if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
//If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
//If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
//If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.
